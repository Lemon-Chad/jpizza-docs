# Usage

## Installation

### Windows Installer

Using the Windows Installer for JPizza, you can easily install the .exe, afterward simply add
C:\DP\ to your PATH.

### Non-Windows OS

You can download the latest JAR file from the GitHub repository and put it in
a directory of your choosing. Then add that directory to your PATH.

## Running Files

To run a file, you can simply call `dp` from the command line followed by the file path. The file extension must be a `.devp` file.

**NOTE**: *It does not automatically assume your current working directory, so you will have to pass the full path or use your OS's equivalant of %CD%.*
